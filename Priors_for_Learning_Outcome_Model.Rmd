Forming Priors

Prior distributions for our model are set based on previous literature and inputs from experts. Experts' inputs are obtained via focused group discussion and survey. 

## Stage 1: Priors from literature

The objectives of collecting prior information from literature:

- To identify variables that have direct association with the targeted outcome
- To identify the direction and degree of associations between the variables and the outcome
- To explore the (qualitative) values of outcomes affected by different variables (when         applicable)

### Applicability and generalizability of data on our population 

The applicability and generalizability of data are determined by the extent of similarity between the study population and our population. 

#### Background info of our population

+ Location- Yangon, Myanmar
+ Population- Professional football players
+ Gender- Male and Female 
+ Age- 15 to 30
+ Education level- highschool to college level students, older players are university           graduates

#### Intervention 1: Improving Nutritional Self-reliance

+ Nutrition education (Nutrition Guide and a series of in-person classes)
    + Food groups (basic level)
    + Types of nutrients (basic level)
    + Healthy plate (basic level)
    + Macronutrient and fluid requirements (Intermediate to advance level)
    + Calculation of protein-energy requirements (Advance level)
    + Food exchange (Advance level)

#### Intervention 2: Guided Personalized Nutrition

+ Nutrition education (a 3-hour in-person class)
    + Food groups (basic level)
    + Types of nutrients (basic level)
    + Healthy plate (basic level)
    + Macronutrient and fluid requirements (Intermediate level)
