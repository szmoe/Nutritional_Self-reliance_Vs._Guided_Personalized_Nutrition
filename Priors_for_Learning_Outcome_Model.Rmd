Forming Priors

Prior distributions for our model are set based on previous literature and inputs from experts. Experts' inputs are obtained via focused group discussion and survey. 

## Stage 1: Priors from literature

The objectives of collecting prior information from literature:

- To identify variables that have direct association with the targeted outcome
- To identify the direction and degree of associations between the variables and the outcome
- To explore the changes in values of outcomes affected by different variables (when         applicable)

### Applicability and generalizability of data on our population 

The applicability and generalizability of data are determined by the extent of similarity between the study population and our population. 

#### Background info of our population

+ Location- Yangon, Myanmar
+ Population- Professional football players
+ Gender- Male and Female 
+ Age- 15 to 30
+ Education level- highschool to college level students, older players are university           graduates

#### Intervention 1: Improving Nutritional Self-reliance

+ Nutrition education (Nutrition Guide and a series of in-person classes)
    + Food groups (basic level)
    + Types of nutrients (basic level)
    + Healthy plate (basic level)
    + Macronutrient and fluid requirements (Intermediate to advance level)
    + Calculation of protein-energy requirements (Advance level)
    + Food exchange (Advance level)

#### Intervention 2: Guided Personalized Nutrition

+ Nutrition education (a 3-hour in-person class)
    + Food groups (basic level)
    + Types of nutrients (basic level)
    + Healthy plate (basic level)
    + Macronutrient and fluid requirements (Intermediate level)

Communication skills and learning motivation contribute  to  the  value  of  student  learning  outcomes  by  21.60%,  while  the  remaining 78.40% is contributed by other factors not examined in this study. Other variables  that  were  not  examined  were  internal  factors  (health,  intelligence,  interests)  and external factors (family and community environment).

#### $\color{brown}{\text{Changes in Value of Outcome}}$

Student's  creativity, interest, and creativity and interest  have an  effect  of  14%, 41.8% and 50.3%  on  student  achievement  in  economics  subjects  for class  XI  Social  Sciences SMA  Ekasakti  Padang, the remaining 49.7% is influenced by several other  factors. 


#### $\color{green}{\text{Generate Initial Model}}$

We chose 4 papers as reference for our initial priors. Our search focused on the papers that studied variables with potential impact on learning outcome in a traditional classroom setting. Intervention studies (novel teaching method, learning environment, hybrid classroom, etc) were excluded. 

None of the selected studies has a population closely matched (high applicability) to our target population. Hence, the papers' findings cannot be applied directly to our model, but they will be useful in building the basic framework of the model. Paper 1, 2 and 4 quantified the relationship between variables (Changes in the Value of Outcome), which could be very useful in coding of our model. Unfortunately due to differences in population and study subject, we were not able to use those results. 

Thus, we summarized the results- usable for our model- of the four papers as follows:

- Student's interest in learning, teacher's attitude and learning hour can improve learning outcome, but if all three exist together (teacher's attitude being significant factor), the impact on learning outcome improves significantly. (beta approx 0.4 to 0.6)
- Teacher's communication skills and student's motivation to learn- particularly if both are present- can improve learning outcome. (explain 21.6% of variation)
- Student's motivation and study habit- particularly when coexist- can improve learning outcome (explain 30.2% of variation)
- Student's creativity and interest in learning- particularly when coexist- can improve learning outcome (explain 50.3% of variation)
