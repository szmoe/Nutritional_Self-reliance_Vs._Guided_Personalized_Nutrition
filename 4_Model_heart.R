### Model 4: Chance of Winning

# This is the heart of the model where statisticians' inputs will be crucial.
# The best scenario would be to have a group of experts with good statistic knowledge
# Experts here include decision analysts, management, football coaches, football players,
# medical staff, and nutritionists

# Decision analyst will surely have good statistic knowledge (very much expected)
# Medical staff and nutritionists may have if they are well-trained in research (at least will hv basic stat knowledge)
# Management, coaches and athletes may not have statistic knowledge but they have experience- 
   # they will be able to identify good parameters and confounders 

## To draw impact pathway model of chosen parameters and possible confounders

# time and recovery

## How to gather parameters/predictors for impact pathway model here?
# 1. Use logical thinking
# 2. Literature review
# 3. Focus group discussion

# It would be hard to predict good/bad predictors and their correlations even with literature review-
# due to differences in population and circumstances, etc.

# A real regression analysis method may not be suitable here but how can I use that logic when all I have are priors? 
# or can estimates be likelihood and I draw samples??

# Remember I'm not predicting the future outcome accurately, but simulating the most possible outcome given the 
# current circumstances. So, the result is not the future but a good predictor of the future?? 
# If I use all predictors gathered from focus group discussion and giving estimates to those, 
# I'm assuming causal relationships between each variable in input table and the outcome variable.
# And all those relationships give either positive or negative effect on outcome variables. 
# And, everything is more or less normal distribution. I'm not considering the effects of predictors on each other
# and those predictors might not be a good predictors for the targeted outcome. Basically, I am assuming all those
# predictor are perfectly independent of each other and have established causal relationship with the outcome, giving
# intercept values as ranges of estimates. 
# Need to vet those predictors- how to do that without observed data?? think think think
