### Model 4: Chance of Winning

# The question is "can improved nutrition result in higher chance of winning a football game?" 
# Here, higher chance does not mean actually winning the game, so this is a logical expectation: 
# sports performance improves with good nutrition and that can increase chance of winning to 
# some extent. But, this is a linear assumption: every action leads to desired outcome. 
# In the complexity of life, this assumption can be seriously flawed- a number of factors may override our action 
# and gives an unrelated outcome without improving our chance at all. A regression analysis can take some of these
# factors into consideration but the model is trying to predict future with little data. 

# So, I should treat this model as a weather forecast (the example given in the stat book). Weather forecasts are
# based on previous weather patterns and it can be wrong when an unexpected factor comes to play? But they can be 
# very accurate in short-term predictions, etc. That means i don't need to wreck my brain to find good predictors
# for my model or create samples, but need to draw out obvious patterns. The model is progressive, so it
# will become a stronger decision support tool as more data becomes available or current patterns are enough. 
# I think I get it. Various experts will give various inputs, and I need to select patterns and input with high
# relevancy (also some historical data if possible). Build initial trends with it and refine the model as
# I collect more data. 

# What if I build the model backwards? It might work.
