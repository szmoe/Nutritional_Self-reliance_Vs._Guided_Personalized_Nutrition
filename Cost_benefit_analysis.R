### Model 5: Cost and Benefit analysis

# The usual thing but find sources to assign monetary values to health/nutrition/sports outcomes
# Also find ways calculate discount rate/ inflation rate (it won't do to just copy rates from other ppl's models)

### NO GUT FEELINGS!!! EVERYTHING MUST HAVE LOGICAL LINKS AND EXPLANATIONS!!! 

# Can I use experts' estimates??- possible if decision makers trust the experts or they are the experts themselves
    # otherwise, the decision makers will take the estimates as unfounded gut feelings. 
# But I don't have experts atm, so no gut feelings- data data data!


# Calculate costs based on Food_type model, and Learning_behavior model

# Calculate benefit based on Model_heart
