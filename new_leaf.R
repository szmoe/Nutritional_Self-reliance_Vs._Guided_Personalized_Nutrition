# Try the model again after Monte Carlo Chapter
# The first attempt was very frequentist- I was trying to simulate the truth as 
# best as possible 
# Based on DA course, process needs to be:
# 1. Simple and not time-consuming (not data-driven; try to make decision even when data is scarce)
# 2. Start simple and add on complexity
# 3. Collect data from any possible sources- transdisplinary

# Based on statistical rethinking, bayesian process is similar to frequentist in base theory
# So, the basic principles still apply- I can't go to town with the model just coz the decisionSupport
# package allows 
# Problem with overfitting with complex models- meaning here in DA model, unnecessary complexity brings in chaos!

## In order to build a good model, I think I need to learn more on:

## Bayesian Statistics: 
# I initially thought Bayesian statistics is something new. I mistook how the
# decisionSupport package works as Bayesian statistics- no rules and lots of freedom and I got 
# super excited (since frequentist approach has lots of rules) and got carried away in my first try. 
# Now I'm reading rethinking, I understood Bayesian is something different, not something totally new.
# So, I need to be a good statistician to build a good model. Being a nutritionist doesn't matter anymore.
# Nutrition knowledge is pretty much straightforward (anyone can learn it), but I need to think like a
# good statistician to build a good nutrition model. A nutritionist without good statistic knowledge 
# would do senseless causal correlations (esp when decisionSupport allows estimate range for uncertainty),
# and overestimate the outcome. And most (if not all) nutrition studies report positive results. 
# A good statistician would see limitations and confounds, and know how to properly use the finding without
# being overconfident about the results. 

## Economics:
# I need to learn how to assess economic values of intangible things. I plan to read "how to 
# measure anything" but still at first chapter. Also, I need to look up more resources on how
# economists assign values to health outcomes.

## Simulation is for a small homogenous group- so less generalization)
## I may be able to treat it as client level- not population level

# Do base/ standard first
