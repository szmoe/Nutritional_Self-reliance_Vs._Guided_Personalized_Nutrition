# Try the model again after Monte Carlo Chapter
# The first attempt was very frequentist- I was trying to simulate the truth as 
# best as possible 
# Based on DA course, process needs to be:
# 1. Simple and not time-consuming (not data-driven; try to make decision even when data is scarce)
# 2. Start simple and add on complexity
# 3. Collect data from any possible sources- transdisplinary

# Based on statistical rethinking, bayesian process is similar to frequentist in base theory
# So, the basic principles still apply- I can't go to town with the model just coz the decisionSupport
# package allows 
# Problem with overfitting with complex models- meaning here in DA model, unnecessary complexity brings in chaos!


## Simulation is for a small homogenous group- so less generalization)
## I may be able to treat it as client level- not population level

# Do base/ standard first
