### Nutritional_Self-reliance_Vs._Guided_Personalized_Nutrition

A comparison between two nutrition intervention options to improve nutrition status among young trainees in football academy at MFF (Myanmar Football Federation). 

The two options are "Enhancing nutritional self-reliance of trainees with Nutrition Education" and "Guided Personalized Nutrition by Sports nutritionist."

The first option is currently practiced at MFF where young trainess are provided with buffet-style meals, and they can serve themselves the type of food and amount they prefer. A nutrition guide developed in 2020 is used to improve nutrition knowledge (especially calorie counting) of the young trainees to enhance better meal choices for optimum performance. 

The second option is to hire a nutritionist trained in sports nutrition. The nutritionist is to adopt personalized nutrition approach for each trainee to ensure optimal health and perfomance. 

Decision Analysis Approach is used to compare the costs and benefits of the two intervention options for the best possible outcome.
